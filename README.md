#TravelInn OOPs Project
##Overview
The TravelInn project is a console-based application built in C++ to simulate a travel booking system. It employs core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling. The project allows users to register as customers or admins, update their profiles, and generate booking receipts. Admins have the ability to manage bookings and notifications, while customers can receive updates and access their travel information.

##Features

Two types of users: Admins and Customers.
Users can update their profiles and change passwords.

Error Handling:

Custom exceptions are raised for application errors like invalid user actions.
Notifications:
